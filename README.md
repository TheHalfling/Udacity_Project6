##Summary

This visualization shows baseball player statistics by charting their BMI in a bubble chart. The resulting bubbles are colored based on the handedness of the player. I included an interactive legend for the handedness to allow the user to filter the data.

The user of this visualization will notice that the overall disribution of BMI is roughly normal in distribution, which is not surprising over any population of people.  It is interesting to see that the players with the highest career home run count are concentrated on the range of BMI from 24 to 26.  This range of BMI bridges from healthy to overweight.  Since BMI can cause those with heavy muscle mass to be mis-represented as overweight I am not surprised by these finding.  Though it should be noted that since we have limited information we can not determine for sure if the players marked as overweight are in that range due to muscle mass.

##Design

The original design actually plotted height versus number of home runs, but still included the interactive legend 
and coloring for handedness. My initial round of feedback showed that this graph did not really introduce any information
that could not have been assumed since height falls under a bell curve like was shown on the chart. This led to experimenting with adding another dimension to the data resulting int he height vs weight it is now.

The next addition to the chart was some flavor text to introduce the visualization, a rewording of the supporting text for
the interactive legend, and setting the bubbles on the chart to change color when hovered over to make it clear which point 
was being hovered on.

Added the coloring changes to the bubble when hovered over.  Adjusted the data to convert B,R,L to Both, Right, Left.  Converted the text at the top into bullet points for quicker conveyance of information.

After the feedback from the first review, the chart was adjusted again.  I added a calculated field to the dataset to list the BMI and the rating that BMI is listed as (Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, or Obese).  By adjusting the chart to Home Runs vs BMI, I could find a strong finding showing that those with the heighest Home Run numbers fell within a certain BMI range.  Essentially this conveyed the same information as the previous chart but in a far clearer way.

##Feedback

Version 1 Feedback (height vs HR, colored by handedness): 

Jorge: Graph looks good. There is obviously a bell curve to the data
when presented with all players and height vs. HR. It is hard to see if that bell curve shifts as you go through the handedness
of the player. Perhaps adding a bell curve would help to show that.

Chris: Graph is ok but doesnâ€™t really convey any interesting or unknown information since height is a known bell
curve regardless of what you are charting for the y. Perhaps adding a fourth dimension related to bubble size would
help to convey a more interesting data set.

Version 2 Feedback (height vs weight, colored by handedness, bubble size by HR): Colinearity is not generally explanatory,
In a reasonably fit athlete, height and weight are going to be colinear. Number of home runs may be somewhat correlated with
time, but even then would be interesting to track. Did you look at the data in Excel or R? They may help with testing for colinearity.
From a look and feel point of view, the program worked fine and the dots showed well on both the computer and my phone.

Since the feedback from the first review of the project was that a clear finding was not evident in the visualization I went through several different iterations of the data to find a way to show a clear finding from the data.  This resulted in adding in BMI as a way to show a height/weight ratio that could then be compared to home runs.  This looks like a clearer finding of information.
